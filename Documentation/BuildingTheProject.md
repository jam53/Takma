# Building The Project
- Update [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) to reflect the changes in this release.
- Since we are publishing a new version of the application, we should increment the version number. For Takma we use the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) convention to update the version number.
    - In summary:
      - Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
        - MAJOR version when making major (breaking) changes.
        - MINOR version when adding new features or improvements.
        - PATCH version when making bugfixes or small improvements.


- Run `npm i`.
- Run `npm run build`, the generated files will be placed inside `/dist`.
