 * Given a path to an image file, this function returns an url to the image.
 *
 * We cant just use the path of the image as the src for our img tags because of how Tauri works. Instead we read the image path as a binary file, create a blob and then create an url from that blob
 * @param path Path to the image file. It can be either an absolute path or a relative path.
 * @param baseDirectory Optional base directory from which the relative path starts. Only required if the path is relative.
